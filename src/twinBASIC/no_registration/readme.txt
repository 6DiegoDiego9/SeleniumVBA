This folder holds an example set demonstrating how the twinBASIC DLL can be used without registration. THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED SETUP, but just to show the possibilities....

You can find the 32- and 64-bit versions of the DLL's in the https://github.com/GCuser99/SeleniumVBA/tree/main/src/twinBASIC/Build folder of this repository.

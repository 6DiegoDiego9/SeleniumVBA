Note: before you can use the two example files:
   SeleniumVBA test subs for tB.xlsm
   SeleniumVBA test subs for tB.accdb

You must open them and set a reference to SeleniumVBA.

   From the VBIDE: Tools->References
   Scroll down until you find SeleniumVBA
   Click in the checkbox next to SeleniumVBA
   Click OK, and then save the workbook/database

The above only needs to be performed once.

The BuildAddin.xlsm provides functionality for (re)building the SeleniumVBA.xlam macro file and for publishing GitHub components (source, zip file, etc). Advanced knowledge of working with GitHub Desktop and the VBIDE object model is required. Please note if all that is needed is a copy of SeleniumVBA.xlam, then download the xlam (or zip) file from the "dist" folder. The macro provided here is intended to make life easier for contributors/collaborators - modify as you see fit.

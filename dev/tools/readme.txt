The UpdateVersion.xlsm macro Workbook provides functionality for (re)building the SeleniumVBA.xlam and SeleniumVBA.accdb macro files and for publishing GitHub components (source, zip file, etc). Advanced knowledge of working with GitHub Desktop and the VBIDE object model is required. Please note if all that is needed is a copy of SeleniumVBA.xlam, then download the xlam file from the "dist" folder. The macros provided here are intended to make life easier for contributors/collaborators. I have spent little effort making this user-friendly - modify as you see fit.
